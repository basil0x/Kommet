# Kommet 🌠

**Kommet** is a simple comet simulation developed using **Qt** and **Qt Creator**. This project was created as part of a university course assignment for **Osnovi Mehanike** (Fundamentals of Mechanics) at the **Faculty of Mathematics**, University of Belgrade.

## 📚 About the Project

Kommet is designed to simulate the motion of a comet under gravitational influence of a star. The purpose of the project is to visualize basic mechanical principles in a dynamic, interactive environment.

This simulation showcases:

- Orbital motion of a comet  
- Real-time rendering using Qt  
- Basic physical modeling of gravitational mechanics

## 🛠️ Built With

- **C++**
- **Qt Framework**
- **Qt Creator** (as the IDE)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run or build the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download)
- Qt Creator (recommended IDE)
- C++ compiler supported by Qt

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
